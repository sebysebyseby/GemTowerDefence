# GemTowerDefence
My first game, it should be pretty awesome :)

This is a recreation of the original Gemtowerdefense, I just wanted to see if I could successfully recreate it, and
maybe even add on to it a bit.

If you don't know the basics of GemTD, it's like any regular tower defense games where you have to kill the enemies that spawn 
per wave so they don't reach the end of the track and make you lose lives. What makes GemTD special is that instead of choosing
which towers you want to build, every wave you get to place 5 random gems (towers), and you get to keep one of them. As you collect
gems, if you have a specific combination of gems in the game you can combine them together to create special towers. Only these
special towers can be upgraded with gold. 

The other interesting concept of GemTD is you can create mazes for the enemies to get to the various checkpoints, which can give
your towers more time to shoot at them. Good mazes are crucial later in the game!
